Title: Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective: Understand the dataset, perform data cleaning, build a classification model to predict passenger survival.

Dataset: Briefly describe the Titanic dataset, including features like age, gender, class, etc.

Data Cleaning: Outline the steps taken to clean the data, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Model Building: Describe the classification algorithms used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) and the rationale behind their selection.

Conclusion: Summarize findings and insights gained from the analysis.

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including features such as:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Ticket fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Data Cleaning
Steps taken to clean the data include:

Handling Missing Values:
Filled missing values in the Age column with the mean age.
Filled missing values in the Embarked column with the mode.
Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive missing values.

Encoding Categorical Variables:
Converted Sex and Embarked into numeric values using label encoding.

Model Building
Classification algorithms used:
Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification.
Decision Tree Classifier: A simple yet interpretable model.

Conclusion
Summarize findings and insights gained from the analysis, highlighting the best-performing model and the importance of feature selection and preprocessing in improving model accuracy. Discuss potential future work, such as exploring additional features or advanced modeling techniques.
